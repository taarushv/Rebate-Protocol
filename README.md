# Rebate Protocol

Rebate Protocol offers manufacturers a simple web interface to create QR code-based wallets. It also allows for users to seamlessly scan a QR code and verify the authenticity and origin of the product they use. By embedding a QR-based rebate mechanism, manufacturers can provide customers with an incentive to scan the QR codes inside their medical containers. Having a simple mobile app that helps customers to redeem their rebate ethereum and also checking the digital signature of the product leads to a cost-effective way to eliminate most forms of counterfeiting. Especially in the developing world where this problem is rampant and ever-increasing. Along with combining elements of technology with low barriers of entry, it creates a situation where fraudulent actors are effectively locked out of participation.
